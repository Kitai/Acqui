This is the github repository for an acquisition experiment investigating children's intepretation of comparative and excessive constructions with mid-scale terms like "warmer" or "too hot."

The images and sound files here are the ones used in the PCIbex experiment.

The folder data_includes contains all the scripts used in the experiment.

The CSV table is currently fetched from Google Spreadsheets (this will change for offline child data collection).
